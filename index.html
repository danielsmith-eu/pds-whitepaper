<!-- 
* Features of any good data store (eg S3, DropBox)

- Availability (always reach PDS)
- PDS Portability (switch to another PDS)
- Reliability (not losing bits -- shorter term than durability)
- Scalability (bits, bits per second, triples, people, independent PDS operators)
- Open Standard Technologies

* What most Personal Data Store projects are going for

- Improved Privacy Protection / Identity Management (support for pseudonymous participation in groups and anonymous participation,attribute validation - e.g. proof that someone is over 18, has a phd, has at least 1000 WoW points, etc)

* Using Semantic Web standards (RDF, OWL, RIF, Prov) gives us:

- Application Integration (multiple apps using the same data)
- Application Portability (users can switch to another app)
- Provenance Maintenance (where did this fact come from? proof/authority, tamperproofing data, signatures)

* And then: Social Features

- Social Network Provider Portability (share w/people who wont use facebook)
- Supporting Synchronous+Async Collaboration
- Distributed collaborative filtering, such as for supporting recommendations
- Distributed search (find something just given some of its attributes)
- Data licensing/handling support (if you use this data , burn after reading etc)
- Durability (data still available and meaningful in 50 years)
